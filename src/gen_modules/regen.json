Curious, he decided to explore the cave and see what secrets it held.\n\nIt didn't take long for Sir John to discover that the cave was the lair of an ancient dragon. The dragon was awoken by Sir John's presence and immediately attacked. Sir John fought bravely, but was quickly overpowered by the dragon's immense strength. In a last attempt to save himself, Sir John shouted out a mysterious incantation.\n\nTo his surprise, the dragon stopped in its tracks and bowed to Sir John. The dragon had been cursed by a powerful wizard and was under his control. Sir John was able to convince the dragon to let him go, and the two became unlikely friends. Together, Sir John and the dragon set off on many adventures, and have since become legendary tales in the kingdom.",

The materials used for these garments are often highly polluting, and the manufacturing process is characterized by high levels of waste, water, and air pollution. Additionally, fast fashion is associated with the exploitation of garment workers, as manufacturers seek to keep labor costs as low as possible. In light of this, it is clear that fast fashion negatively impacts the environment and communities around the world.",

The agreement also contains provisions on providing financial support to developing countries, to help them access clean energy technology, and to help them cope with the effects of climate change.
